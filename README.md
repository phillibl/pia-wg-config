## Background

Based off of the [manual-connections](https://github.com/pia-foss/manual-connections) scripts provided FOSS by Private Internet Access. 

Golang was chosen to provide stability and portability to the scripts.

`pia-wg-config` is entirely self-contained and does require any external files.
